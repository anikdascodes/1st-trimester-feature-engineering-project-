## 🎯 Overview

This project implements advanced feature engineering techniques for first trimester data analysis. The goal is to extract meaningful features from raw data to improve predictive model performance and gain insights into first trimester patterns.

### Key Objectives

- Extract and transform raw features into meaningful representations
- Handle missing data and outliers effectively
- Create domain-specific features based on medical/biological knowledge
- Optimize feature selection for model performance
- Build a reproducible data pipeline

## ✨ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Robust data cleaning and normalization
- **Feature Extraction**: Automated feature generation from raw data
- **Feature Selection**: Statistical and model-based feature selection methods
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, t-SNE, and other techniques
- **Feature Encoding**: Categorical encoding, binning, and scaling
- **Pipeline Automation**: End-to-end automated feature engineering pipeline
- **Visualization**: Comprehensive data and feature visualization tools

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip or conda package manager
- Git
- (Optional) Docker for containerized development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anikdascodes/1st-trimester-feature-engineering-project-.git
cd 1st-trimester-feature-engineering-project-
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
# Using venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Or using conda
conda create -n trimester-fe python=3.8
conda activate trimester-fe
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up data directories**

```bash
mkdir -p data/{raw,processed,features}
```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Feature Engineering Pipeline

```python
from src.features import FeatureEngineer
from src.data import DataLoader

# Load data
loader = DataLoader('data/raw/trimester_data.csv')
df = loader.load()

# Initialize feature engineer
fe = FeatureEngineer()

# Apply feature engineering
features = fe.transform(df)

# Save engineered features
features.to_csv('data/features/engineered_features.csv', index=False)
```

### Running Notebooks

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

### Training Models

```bash
python src/models/train.py --config config/model_config.yaml
```

## 🔧 Feature Engineering Techniques

### 1. **Temporal Features**
- Date/time decomposition (day, week, month)
- Time since event calculations
- Seasonal patterns

### 2. **Statistical Features**
- Rolling statistics (mean, std, min, max)
- Aggregations by groups
- Percentile-based features

### 3. **Domain-Specific Features**
- Medical indicators and thresholds
- Risk scores and composite metrics
- Interaction features

### 4. **Encoding Techniques**
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Target encoding for high-cardinality features
- Ordinal encoding for ordered categories

### 5. **Scaling and Normalization**
- StandardScaler for normal distributions
- MinMaxScaler for bounded features
- RobustScaler for outlier-resistant scaling

## 🔄 Data Pipeline

The project implements a modular data pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Load raw data from various sources
2. **Data Validation**: Check data quality and schema
3. **Preprocessing**: Clean, impute, and normalize data
4. **Feature Engineering**: Apply transformation and feature creation
5. **Feature Selection**: Select most relevant features
6. **Output**: Save processed features for modeling

## 🤖 Model Training

The project supports multiple machine learning models:

- Linear Models (Logistic Regression, Linear Regression)
- Tree-Based Models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Neural Networks (MLP, Custom architectures)
- Ensemble Methods

## 📊 Results
